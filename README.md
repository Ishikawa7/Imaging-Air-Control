# Imaging-Based Air Quality Control System

## Overview

This project implements a prototype simulation of an **Imaging-based Air Quality Control System** that combines computer vision, predictive modeling, and real-time optimization to monitor and control indoor air quality. The system uses webcam-based object detection to count people in a room, predicts CO‚ÇÇ levels, and automatically optimizes ventilation pump power to maintain air quality below safety thresholds.

## Project Architecture

The system consists of several interconnected components:

### 1. **Real-time Imaging System** (`imaging.py`)
- **YOLO v5 Object Detection**: Uses a pre-trained YOLOv5 model to detect objects in real-time from webcam feed

- **Supported Objects**: Detects 80 different object classes (COCO dataset classes)

### 2. **Air Quality Simulation** (`simulator.py`)
- **CO‚ÇÇ Level Prediction**: Simulates and predicts CO‚ÇÇ concentrations based on:
  - Room volume (m¬≥)

  - Ambient air pump capacity (L/min)
  - Current pump power percentage
  - Number of active pumps
- **Thread-safe Operations**: Uses queue-based communication for real-time updates

- **System Parameter Monitoring**: Detects anomalies in system variables (CO‚ÇÇ, pump power, etc.)
- **Isolation Forest Implementation**: Uses unsupervised learning to identify unusual system states
- **Real-time Alerts**: Provides immediate feedback on system anomalies

### 6. **Web-based Dashboard** (`app_test.py`)
